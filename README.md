## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learnt to use the transform property to section my work. I also learnt two ways of merging a background color with a background image.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.container {
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

The areas I would like to focus on are the CSS Grids and Flexbox. Also, i would love to learn about the Linear Gradient.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.pluralsight.com) - This helped me for Flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.css-tricks.com) - This is an amazing article which helped with the center positioning of the container.
